“Hi, I am  Ashutosh, and I’m a Data Engineer with nearly 2 years of experience in telecom analytics and ETL processes, 
primarily using the RAID Revenue Assurance platform. I’ve worked on designing and maintaining ETL pipelines, integrating data from multiple sources,
and performing complex data transformations to support risk and revenue assurance in telecom. I'm skilled in SQL, Python, PySpark, GCP, and 
Oracle SQL Developer, and I’m passionate about building efficient, reliable data systems that drive business insights. 
I’m excited to bring my experience and technical skills to a forward-thinking team where I can continue to grow and contribute meaningfully.”





PySpark(data processing) means-
-PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, used to process large-scale data efficiently across multiple machines.
-Data processing in PySpark refers to reading, transforming, and analyzing large datasets using Python code and Spark’s powerful engine.

Steps in PySpark Data Processing:
Load data
→ From files like CSV, JSON, Parquet, Hive tables, etc.
df = spark.read.csv("data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)


Transform data
→ Filter, join, group, sort, clean, or format the data
df_filtered = df.filter(df["age"] > 25)

Process data
→ Aggregations, calculations, business logic
df_grouped = df.groupBy("city").agg(F.avg("salary"))

Save data
→ Store the result in files or databases
df_grouped.write.csv("output.csv")




Hadoop(HDFS, basic mapReduce concepts) means —

Hadoop stores huge data across multiple computers using HDFS, and processes it using MapReduce — by breaking tasks into small parts (Map) and combining the results (Reduce).

Component.      Purpose                            Example

HDFS           Store big data safely        Split and replicate files
Map.            Process data chunks        Create key-value pairs
Reduce        Aggregate results             Count, sum, average, etc.





ETL pipeline design and execution. means —

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load — a common process used to move and prepare data from one system to another for analysis or reporting.
Extract data from source systems
Transform it into a clean and usable format
Load it into a database, data warehouse, or cloud platform

ETL pipeline design = planning how to move and prepare your data.
ETL pipeline execution = actually running that plan to get the final data output.
















Here’s a simple explanation of Hadoop, HDFS, and basic MapReduce concepts:

🗂️ What is Hadoop?
Hadoop is an open-source framework that helps store and process large amounts of data across many computers (nodes) in a distributed and fault-tolerant way.

It has two main parts:

HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) — for storage

MapReduce — for processing

📦 HDFS – Hadoop Distributed File System
✅ What it does:
Stores big files by splitting them into blocks (default 128MB)

Distributes blocks across multiple nodes

Automatically replicates blocks (usually 3 copies) to prevent data loss

🧠 Example:
If you store a 512MB file:

It will be split into 4 blocks (128MB each)

Each block will be stored on different machines

Even if one machine fails, data is safe (due to replication)

⚙️ MapReduce – Processing Engine
MapReduce is the programming model in Hadoop to process large datasets in two steps:

🔹 1. Map Phase
Break the data into key-value pairs

Each mapper runs in parallel

Example: count words

text
Copy
Edit
Input: "cat dog cat"
Output: (cat, 1), (dog, 1), (cat, 1)
🔹 2. Reduce Phase
Combine values by key

Example:

text
Copy
Edit
Input: (cat, [1,1]), (dog, [1])
Output: (cat, 2), (dog, 1)
🧠 In Simple Words:
Hadoop stores huge data across multiple computers using HDFS, and processes it using MapReduce — by breaking tasks into small parts (Map) and combining the results (Reduce).

🔁 Summary Table:
Component	Purpose	Example
HDFS	Store big data safely	Split and replicate files
Map	Process data chunks	Create key-value pairs
Reduce	Aggregate results	Count, sum, average, etc.
