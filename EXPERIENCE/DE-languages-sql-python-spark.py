Great question! In practice, **data engineers use both combinations** â€” **Python with SQL** and **Python with Spark** â€” depending on the **scale**, **complexity**, and **environment** of the data workflows they are handling.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of when and why each combination is used:

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Python + SQL**: Most Common in Traditional Pipelines

#### **Use Cases:**

* ETL/ELT workflows in small to medium-sized data environments
* Data pipelines interacting with **relational databases** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server)
* Orchestration tools like **Airflow**, **dbt**, **Dagster**, **Prefect**, etc.
* Cloud services like **BigQuery**, **Redshift**, **Snowflake**, which are SQL-first platforms

#### **Why it's used:**

* SQL is efficient for **data querying and transformation**
* Python is great for **scripting**, **automation**, and **connecting** tools/services (APIs, cloud storage, etc.)
* Easy to develop and debug locally
* Works well when the data size is not massive

#### Example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlalchemy

engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine('postgresql://user:password@host/db')
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sale_date >= '2023-01-01'", engine)
```

### ðŸ”¹ **Python + Spark**: For Big Data Workloads

#### **Use Cases:**

* Processing **large-scale datasets** (terabytes+)
* Distributed data environments (Hadoop, AWS EMR, Databricks)
* Batch + streaming data pipelines (e.g. real-time ingestion)
* ETL for data lakes (e.g. S3, Delta Lake, HDFS)

#### **Why it's used:**

* **Spark** enables distributed computing
* Python (via **PySpark**) makes Spark easier to work with than Scala or Java
* Powerful for transformations, joins, aggregations at scale

#### Example:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("MyApp").getOrCreate()
df = spark.read.csv("s3://my-bucket/large-dataset.csv", header=True)
df_filtered = df.filter(df["amount"] > 1000)
df_filtered.write.parquet("s3://my-bucket/output/")
```

### âœ… So, Which Should a Data Engineer Learn/Use?

| Situation                                    | Recommended Stack                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Traditional pipelines, SQL DBs, cloud DWHs   | **Python + SQL**                          |
| Big data, distributed processing, data lakes | **Python + Spark**                        |
| Cloud-native (AWS, GCP, Azure)               | **Both** (often used together)            |
| Real-time streaming pipelines                | **Python + Spark (Structured Streaming)** |
