Here's a small end-to-end GCP Data Engineering project using multiple Google Cloud Platform services and modern data engineering tools. The goal is to provide hands-on experience with key GCP components often used in real-world data workflows.

## Project: ETL Pipeline for E-Commerce Sales Analytics

### Scenario
You work for an e-commerce company wanting to analyze sales data. You will ingest raw CSV files to Cloud Storage, process and cleanse the data using DataProc (PySpark), orchestrate workflows with Cloud Composer, optionally enrich data using Data Fusion, load it into BigQuery for analytics, and enforce permissions with IAM.

### Step 1: Data Ingestion with Cloud Storage

- **Upload sample CSV sales data** to a dedicated Cloud Storage bucket (`gs://your-project-sales-data/raw/`).
- Example file: `sales_data_YYYYMMDD.csv`.

### Step 2: Data Cleansing and Transformation with DataProc (PySpark)

- **Provision a DataProc cluster** (managed Spark/Hadoop service).
- **Write a PySpark script** to:
    - Read CSV data from Cloud Storage.
    - Parse, cleanse (remove bad records), and aggregate sales by product, region, or time.
    - Output cleansed data as Parquet or CSV back to a `processed/` directory in Cloud Storage.
- Save and test the PySpark script on your DataProc cluster.

### Step 3: Optional Data Enrichment with Cloud Data Fusion

- Use Data Fusion (UI-based ETL) for additional transformations:
    - Join the processed sales data with product metadata or calendar data.
    - Simple drag-and-drop pipelines can be used.
    - Output enriched data to a new Cloud Storage location.

### Step 4: Orchestration with Cloud Composer (Airflow)

- **Set up a Cloud Composer environment** (managed Apache Airflow).
- Create a DAG (workflow) to:
    - Detect when new files arrive in Cloud Storage.
    - Run the DataProc PySpark job.
    - Optionally run Data Fusion pipeline.
    - Load results into BigQuery.
- Use Python code to define your DAG, and create tasks for each pipeline segment.

### Step 5: Data Loading and Analytics with BigQuery

- **Create a BigQuery dataset and table** for your processed sales data.
- Write SQL scripts to create summary views or run analytics queries (e.g., top products by region, total revenue trends).
- Load cleansed and enriched data into BigQuery (via Composer or manually).

### Step 6: Secure and Manage Permissions with IAM

- Use IAM to control access:
    - Grant least-privilege roles to each service account (e.g., Composer, DataProc) for GCS and BigQuery access.
    - Restrict human access for production datasets.

## Sample Architecture Diagram

- **User** uploads raw CSV → **Cloud Storage**
- **Composer DAG** triggers on new file:
    - Runs **DataProc PySpark** → Output to Cloud Storage
    - (Optional) **Data Fusion** further transforms and enriches data
- Data loaded into **BigQuery** for analytics and reporting
- **IAM** controls for all roles and access

## Next Steps

- Run a full project walkthrough: upload a sample file, trigger the workflow, and write sample BigQuery SQL to confirm results.
- Expand: Add error handling, logging, monitoring, and alerting for production robustness.
- Bonus: Visualize data in Data Studio (Looker Studio).

Certainly! Below is a **step-by-step guide** to executing the E-Commerce Sales Analytics pipeline project using GCP services and the specified tools. This walkthrough assumes you have appropriate permissions and basic familiarity with the GCP console.

## Step 1: Data Ingestion with Cloud Storage

**Objective:** Upload raw sales CSV data to Cloud Storage.

- **1.1**: Create a Cloud Storage bucket (e.g., `your-project-sales-data`).
    - Navigate to **Cloud Storage** → "Create bucket."
    - Set location, permissions, and storage class as desired.
- **1.2**: Create folders within the bucket: `/raw`, `/processed`, `/enriched`.
- **1.3**: Upload your `sales_data_YYYYMMDD.csv` to the `/raw` folder.

## Step 2: Data Cleansing & Transformation using DataProc (PySpark)

**Objective:** Cleanse and aggregate the data using PySpark on DataProc.

- **2.1**: Create a DataProc cluster.
    - Go to **Dataproc** → "Create cluster."
    - Choose cluster name, region, machine types, and number of workers.
- **2.2**: Write a PySpark script. Save as `sales_etl.py`:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("SalesETL").getOrCreate()

# Replace with your cloud storage path
input_path = "gs://your-project-sales-data/raw/sales_data_YYYYMMDD.csv"
output_path = "gs://your-project-sales-data/processed/cleansed_sales.parquet"

# Read CSV
df = spark.read.option("header", "true").csv(input_path)

# Data cleansing: Drop rows with null sales, remove duplicates, etc.
df_clean = df.dropna(subset=['amount', 'product_id']) \
             .dropDuplicates()

# Aggregation: Calculate sales sum per product
df_agg = df_clean.groupBy('product_id').sum('amount')

# Save as Parquet
df_agg.write.mode('overwrite').parquet(output_path)
```

- **2.3**: Upload this Python script to your GCS bucket or directly to DataProc.
- **2.4**: Submit the job:
    - Dataproc → "Jobs" → "Submit Job"
    - Choose PySpark, specify the script location, and set any needed arguments.

## Step 3: (Optional) Data Enrichment using Data Fusion

**Objective:** Enrich with additional metadata via a Data Fusion pipeline.

- **3.1**: Enable **Cloud Data Fusion** and create an instance.
- **3.2**: Open the Data Fusion UI.
- **3.3**: Create a pipeline:
    - **Source**: GCS (your processed/cleansed Parquet file)
    - **Join/Enrich**: Join with product/region lookup tables as needed.
    - **Sink**: Output enriched data to another GCS path, e.g., `/enriched/`.
- **3.4**: Deploy and run the pipeline.

## Step 4: Orchestration with Cloud Composer (Airflow)

**Objective:** Automate the ETL workflow.

- **4.1**: Create a Cloud Composer environment.
    - Go to **Composer** → Create a new environment.
- **4.2**: Write a Python DAG script (simplified pseudo-DAG):

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.dataproc import DataprocSubmitJobOperator
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.datafusion import CloudDataFusionStartPipelineOperator
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.gcs_to_bigquery import GCSToBigQueryOperator
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG("sales_etl_dag", start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1), schedule_interval=None) as dag:
    dataproc_job = DataprocSubmitJobOperator(...)
    datafusion_job = CloudDataFusionStartPipelineOperator(...)
    load_to_bq = GCSToBigQueryOperator(
        bucket='your-project-sales-data',
        source_objects=['enriched/cleansed_sales.parquet'],
        destination_project_dataset_table='your_dataset.sales',
        ...
    )
    dataproc_job >> datafusion_job >> load_to_bq
```
- **4.3**: Upload the DAG to Composer's `/dags` folder via GCS.
- **4.4**: Trigger the DAG manually or configure it to run on new file arrivals.

## Step 5: Data Loading & Analytics with BigQuery

**Objective:** Query cleansed/enriched data for insights.

- **5.1**: In **BigQuery**, create a dataset (`sales_analysis`) and a table (`sales`).
- **5.2**: Point your Composer task or manually load data from GCS `/enriched/` or `/processed/` into this table.
- **5.3**: Write and run SQL queries, e.g.:

```sql
-- Total sales by product
SELECT product_id, SUM(amount) as total_sales
FROM `sales_analysis.sales`
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

-- Trend analysis
SELECT DATE(timestamp) as sales_date, SUM(amount)
FROM `sales_analysis.sales`
GROUP BY sales_date
ORDER BY sales_date;
```

## Step 6: Secure with IAM

**Objective:** Enforce least-privilege security.

- **6.1**: Go to **IAM & Admin**.
- **6.2**: Assign only necessary permissions for:
    - GCS (Storage Object Admin for Dataproc/Data Fusion, Storage Viewer for BigQuery).
    - BigQuery (BigQuery Data Editor only to service accounts running ETL).
    - Composer/Compute Engine service account access as needed.
- **6.3**: Test access from different accounts to confirm permissions are correct.

## (Optional) Step 7: Visualize in Looker Studio

- Use BigQuery as the data source and create dashboards for sales trends, top products, etc.

## Outcome

- **Workflows** and **data movement** are fully automated from ingestion through analytics.
- You have hands-on experience with the most common GCP data engineering tools.
- Completed sample scripts (Python, PySpark, SQL) and DAGs form a solid project portfolio piece.

If you need sample data, BigQuery U.S. public datasets (e.g., `bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare`) can be used for practice!
