In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), if you want to build ETL pipelines without using Data Fusion, you can still create powerful, 
scalable pipelines by combining several GCP services manually. Here's a list of commonly used services and their roles in a 
typical ETL pipeline:



| ETL Phase   | GCP Service                          | Purpose                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Extract** | **Cloud Storage**                    | For storing raw files (CSV, JSON, Avro, Parquet, etc.). |
|             | **Cloud Pub/Sub**                    | For streaming data ingestion (real-time pipelines).     |
|             | **Cloud SQL / BigQuery / Firestore** | To extract data from structured sources.                |
|             | **Cloud Functions** or **Cloud Run** | To trigger extraction logic (event-driven).             |


| Transform | Dataproc | Managed Apache Spark clusters to run PySpark jobs. |
| | Cloud Dataflow | Managed Apache Beam pipelines (supports batch and streaming). |
| | BigQuery | Can perform SQL-based transformations directly (ELT approach). |
| | Cloud Functions / Cloud Run | For custom Python-based transformations (small jobs). |

| Load | BigQuery | Final destination for analytics-ready data. |
| | Cloud Storage | For storing transformed data or backups. |
| | Cloud SQL / Spanner | For transactional storage or app data sinks. |

| Orchestration | Cloud Composer (Apache Airflow) | For managing and scheduling pipeline steps. |
| | Cloud Scheduler + Pub/Sub + Cloud Functions | Lightweight orchestration. |

ðŸ§  Example: Building a PySpark-based ETL pipeline without Data Fusion
Extract

Upload CSV to Cloud Storage.

Trigger Cloud Function or Composer DAG.

Transform

Use Dataproc to run a PySpark job that reads from Cloud Storage, transforms the data.

Load

Save transformed data to BigQuery or back to Cloud Storage.

âœ… Why skip Data Fusion?
More control and flexibility.

Avoid licensing costs for Cloud Data Fusion (especially for enterprise edition).

Custom logic is easier in Python/PySpark.
