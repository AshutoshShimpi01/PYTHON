WORK EXPERIENCE-

ğŸ”¹ 1. Designed and implemented ETL pipelines processing over 50 TB of data monthly, achieving 99.9% data accuracy for revenue billing.
ğŸ‘‰ You built and managed systems that automatically moved and cleaned huge volumes of data (over 50 terabytes every month).
ğŸ‘‰ These pipelines ensured nearly perfect data quality (99.9% accurate), which is very important for correct revenue billing in telecom.

ğŸ”¹ 2. Integrated data from 20+ sources, enhancing data consistency and reducing discrepancies by 35%.
ğŸ‘‰ You collected data from more than 20 different systems or sources (e.g., databases, files, APIs).
ğŸ‘‰ By unifying and cleaning the data, you fixed mismatches and errors, making the data 35% more consistent and accurate.

ğŸ”¹ 3. Performed complex transformations on datasets exceeding 30 TB using PySpark, reducing data preparation time by 40%.
ğŸ‘‰ You used PySpark to apply advanced data logic (like filtering, joining, aggregating) to massive datasets.
ğŸ‘‰ This helped reduce the time it took to get data ready for analysis by almost half.

ğŸ”¹ 4. Managed data loading into Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Amazon Redshift, supporting queries for over 500 reports and analyses.
ğŸ‘‰ After processing, you loaded the data into different databases (Oracle, Postgres, Redshift).
ğŸ‘‰ This enabled the business teams to run over 500 reports based on your processed data.

ğŸ”¹ 5. Developed validation checks that improved data reliability by 25%, ensuring high-quality data across all ETL processes.
ğŸ‘‰ You created logic and rules to automatically check if data was complete, accurate, and within expected ranges.
ğŸ‘‰ These checks improved overall data quality and trust by 25%.

ğŸ”¹ 6. Devised shell scripts that improved ETL workflow efficiency by 30% and reduced Spark job runtime by 20%.
ğŸ‘‰ You automated parts of the ETL process using shell scripting.
ğŸ‘‰ These optimizations made the system faster and saved computing resources by reducing Spark job runtimes.

ğŸ”¹ 7. Optimized data retrieval using Spark-SQL for datasets over 10 TB, achieving a 15% reduction in query processing time.
ğŸ‘‰ You improved the performance of Spark SQL queries (like filter, groupBy) on large datasets (10+ TB).
ğŸ‘‰ This made data queries run 15% faster.

ğŸ”¹ 8. Created comprehensive ETL documentation, reducing onboarding time for new team members by 50%.
ğŸ‘‰ You wrote clear, detailed documentation for the ETL processes.
ğŸ‘‰ This helped new team members learn the system faster, cutting training time in half.

ğŸ”¹ 9. Collaborated with 15+ clients to deliver customized data solutions, enhancing client satisfaction scores by 20%.
ğŸ‘‰ You worked directly with more than 15 clients to tailor data solutions to their specific needs.
ğŸ‘‰ This improved their satisfaction with your work by 20%.

ğŸ”¹ 10. Developed dashboards that cut data analysis time by 35%, enabling quicker decision-making.
ğŸ‘‰ You built dashboards (likely using tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Looker).
ğŸ‘‰ These helped users quickly understand key data points, reducing the time they spent analyzing data by 35%.
